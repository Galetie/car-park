# Project Brief
This project implements the Smart Parking System prototype for the City of Moondalup, built as part of a smart city
initiative.

* This project uses sensors and displays to:
* Track parking bay availability in real time in uncontrolled car parks
* Show available bays, ambient temperature, and community announcements on digital displays
* Store scanned vehicle licence plates for reference
* Update information promptly as cars enter and exit
